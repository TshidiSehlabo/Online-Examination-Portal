	<h2>ABOUT ONLINE EXAMINATION PORTAL</h2>
	<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, Unisa needed to put systems in place to facilitate online examinations in a very short period of time.<br><br>

During the first week of the examinations, we made some changes to our ICT infrastructure to increase our capacity to deal with the high volumes of examinations. 
During this time, we, unfortunately, had to move a few exam sessions to a later time or date to ensure that no students missed their assessment opportunity. <br><br>

Should we be required to make any further changes to the examination timetable, all affected students will be notified via SMS, 2 days in advance, of any changes, so as not to disadvantage any student. <br><br>

We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause, but thank you for your understanding.</p>
